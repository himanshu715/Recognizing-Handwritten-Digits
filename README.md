# Recognizing-Handwritten-Digits

## Description

Recognizing handwritten text is a problem that can be traced back to the first automatic machines that needed to recognize individual characters in handwritten documents. The data to be analyzed is closely related to numerical values or strings, but can also involve images and sounds.

an estimator with the task of learning through a fit() function, and once it has reached a degree of predictive capability (a model sufficiently valid), it will produce a prediction with the predict() function. Then we will discuss the training set and validation set, created this time from a series of image.

## Technology Used:

IPython Notebook

## Applications:

The scikit-learn library provides numerous datasets that are useful for testing many problems of data analysis and prediction of the results. Also in this case there is a dataset of images called Digits.

The Digits data set of scikit-learn library provides numerous data-sets that are useful for testing many problemsof data analysis and prediction of the results. Some Scientist claims that it predicts the digit accurately 95% of the times. Perform data Analysis to accept or reject this Hypothesis.
